This file was created to explain some peculiarities of repositories used by the slpkg.

SlackBuilds.org (sbo) FAQ(15): 
Slackware current is not supported, but as a general rule, the scripts
should work on it as well.

Slacky.eu (slacky) repository only work with Slackware.com (slack) repository because
slacky repository highlights dependencies where include in Slackware distribution so
'slack' repository needed to distinguish dependencies not included in it.
(Each time you want to use this repository must be enable and the 'slack' repository in
file /etc/slpkg.conf).

Rworkman's (rlw) repository use dependencies where displayed in central site 
'http://rlworkman.net/pkgs/' and only those. Unfortunately there is no fixed reference
dependencies file PACKAGES.TXT.

Studioware (studio) repository has no reference dependencies.

Slackers.it (slackr) repository be used only from Slackware64 current users.
Also find in some packages will not show package description when you run the command
'slpkg -p slackr <package>' and this is because there is not constant reference to the
description of the file 'PACKAGES.TXT' as in other repositories. Some packages reference
dependencies not included in the repository. This can be checked if you run the command
'slpkg -t slackr <package>'. (Example: noticed that the package 'digikam' indicate 
dependence 'ffmpeg' but that is not available from the repository itself).

Slackonly (slonly) repository contains no dependencies on file PACKAGES.TXT and this makes
it difficult to automatically resolve dependencies and in the file PACKAGES.TXT and some
lines with 'PACKAGE NAME:' there is no package so 'slpkg' can not find package.
Users with Slackware x86_64 will use this repository should establish from the beginning 
the list of packages with the command 'slpkg re-create' to be updated with new packages 
and it's because the repository has not 'ChangeLog.txt' file.
